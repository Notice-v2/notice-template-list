ðŸ‘‹ This is the full list of [notice](https://notice.studio) types and templates.

### What is a type?
Example of types: `blog`, `job-board`, `portfolio`. Types are use cases oriented, they have a strong impact on how the app behaves.

### What is a template?
Each type has one or multiple templates, templates mainly handle how types look and are rendered. For instance, the type `blog` has a template `blog-01` and `blog-02`.

### Why this file?
All frontend rendering assets are open source at Notice. But be careful, this file is used across the landing page, frontend, backend and templates at Notice, so we take good care of it. 

### Can I make contributions?
Sure, you can both submit your template informations here or improve the config for existing template. Just make a pull request explaining your changes.
